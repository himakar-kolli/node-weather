# node-weather
1) A Fun Command Line Tool implemented using Node.js (Asynchronous). Uses ES6 Syntax like promises, arrow functions etc.
2) This tool calculates & fetches the current weather information for a given physical address/location on earth.
3) It uses Google's geocode API to calculate latitute & longitude information for a given address (provided by the user via command line). 
4) Using that lat/lng information it contacts Dark Sky's forecast API to retrive the current weather conditions (i.e..current temperature and what it feels like).
