2) Calculates & fetches the current weather information for a given physical address/location on earth.
3) Uses Google's geocode API to calculate Latitute & Longitude information for a given address (provided by the user via command line). 
4) Uses Lat/Lng information obtained above and contacts Dark Sky's forecast API to retrive the current weather conditions (i.e..current temperature and what it feels like).
